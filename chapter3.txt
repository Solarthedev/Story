I have found myself traapped in the depths, it seems like this is another section or "Layer" of the depths. The creatures i have encounter seem to be evolved or enhance versions of creatures commonly found in the etrean luminant. Im going to continue fighting and trying to escape this area i call "The depths: Layer 2"
